    This poster describes my senior research project investigating the biochemical differences between comb jellies (a type of zooplankton) in Puget Sound, Hood Canal, Chesapeake Bay and deep-sea oxygen minimum layers. The project goal was to better understand the mechanisms that these animals use to live in low oxygen estuaries.
