<h2>A Biochemical Approach to Ctenophore Survival in Anoxia</h2>
<p>Kristin D. Henderson & Erik V. Thuesen</p>

<h3>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Ctenophores, jellyfish-like animals that thrive in low oxygen environments, are thought to do so because of metabolic adaptations that allow them to take oxygen from very low oxygen concentrations. As a comparison, this would be analogous to humans being able to cope well in low oxygen environments, such as at high altitudes. Puget Sound ctenophores (<i>e.g. Pleurobrachia bachei</i>) can survive for extended periods without oxygen, but <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>, a species native to Chesapeake Bay, has no tolerance to anoxia. This study investigates the biochemical differences between ctenophores in Puget Sound, Hood Canal, Chesapeake Bay and deep-sea oxygen minimum layers. Oxygen depletion may have an enormous effect on the abundances, diversity, and interactions of marine organisms (Keister <i>et al.</i>, 2000; Diaz and Rosenburg, 1995) by concentrating less hypoxia tolerant organisms in oxygenated waters. In the Chesapeake, <i>M. leidyi</i> population sizes are increasing with increasing environmental degradation and resulting low oxygen levels, and they have begun to outcompete fish larvae. These ctenophores may also impact the shellfish and crab industries. The ultimate goal of this project is to help unravel the mechanisms that zooplankton use to live in low oxygen estuaries to better understand the impacts of worsening environmental conditions in Puget Sound.</p>

<h3>CTENOPHORES</h3>
<p>Ctenophores are gelatinous zooplankton (Fig. 1) similar to jellyfish in that they are carnivorous and are often transparent. They live only in marine environments ranging from estuarine to oceanic, surface to deep-sea, and polar to equatorial. Ctenophores are characterized by eight comb rows of ciliated plates or ctenes which are used for locomotion. Our study includes species representing three different ctenophore Orders (i.e. Cydippida, Lobata, Beroida), each characterized by different means of locomotion and feeding strategies (Wrobel and Mills, 1998).</p>
