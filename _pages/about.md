Hi, I'm Kristin, a biologist and data science graduate student.

I'm a native Virginian and currently live in Leesburg, VA.

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. Since then, I have worked with marine invertebrates, plants, fungi, fruit flies and now fish.

In my current role as a biological research technician at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, I observe and quantify the behavior of miniature, translucent fish in the recently discovered genus, **Danionella**. My ultimate goal is to understand complex navigational behaviors at a neuronal circuit level in a vertebrate system.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. Throughout my career, I have focused on generating data and using analytical tools to extract information to explain those data. While I will always have a passion for the natural world, I am drawn to data science for its ability to reach people across many industries and address a myriad of questions and problems. This passion has led me to pursue graduate work in this field.

Outside of work and school, I volunteer as a Certified Virginia Master Naturalist. I enjoy hiking, fishing, and spending time with my dog.

Please check out my portfolio and feel free to contact me. I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to apply my skills.
