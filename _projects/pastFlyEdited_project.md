        <h5 class="larger-font paragraph">This is data from a study about how brains remember important things. Fruit flies are uniquely useful in the field of neuroscience, because the grow quickly, they have comparatively few neurons and there are genetic tools to isolate and control individual neuron types. While they may seem very different from humans, the way their brains are wired and the mechanisms that their neurons use are quite similar to the brains of other animals including humans. Here, I was investigating if certain neurons that are active when flies learn something new are tagged with a molecular signal. I also wanted to know if these neurons need to be active both when a fly is learning and again later on to enable the formation of memories.</h5>
