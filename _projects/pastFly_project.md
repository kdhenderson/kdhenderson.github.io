    This is unpublished data showing three things. There are two specific neurons in the fruit fly brain which are active after learning, during sleep. If I impair those neurons during memory formation, flies cannot form long-term memories. Similarly if I impair those neurons in a specific time window after learning, flies also cannot form memories.
